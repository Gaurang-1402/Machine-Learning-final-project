# Final Project

## CS-UY 4563 - Introduction to Machine Learning

Spring 2023
Due Date: To Be Announced∗

For your final project, you will work with one other student (from either class) to apply
the machine learning algorithms and techniques you learned in class to a task/problem of
your choosing. You and your partner will present your project to the class at the end of
the semester.
You and your partner need to submit the following documents to Gradescope.

• Your presentation slides

• Your project write-up as a PDF

• Your project code (GitHub link is ok)

• Your dataset - if you made one from scratch

Please note that we will be passing your code and write-up through a plagiarism checker.
We know there are ways to cheat on the final project. If we suspect you of cheating, you
will receive 0 for your final project grade. See the syllabus for additional penalties that
may be applied.

The following are some links you can search for a dataset. Feel free to use any other
datasets or make your own:

• https://vision.eng.au.dk/plant-seedlings-dataset/

• https://www.kaggle.com/competitions

• https://www.openml.org/

• https://paperswithcode.com/datasets

• https://registry.opendata.aws/

∗The projects will be due the evening before the first presentations are given. The date the project will
be due depends on the number of presentations.

Please enter on Brightspace a link to the data set you will use and who your partner is
by March 26th.

Guidelines for your writeup:
1. Introduction: You will briefly describe your data set and the problem you are trying
to solve.
2. Perform some unsupervised analysis: Look to see if any interesting structure
is present in the data. If you don’t find any interesting structure, describe what you
tried.
3. Supervised analysis: You must train at least three of the learning models discussed
in the class (e.g., Logistic regression, SVM, Neural Networks).1 For each model, you
must try different feature transformations and different regularization techniques.
2
For example, try the linear, polynomial, and radial-basis function kernel if you use
support vector machines in your project. Remember to illustrate (through graphs)
how your feature weights and error changed when you used different parameters,
regularizations, and normalizations.
4. Table of Results: You must create a table that contains the final results for your
model. It would be useful to have a table that includes the training accuracy and the
validation accuracy for every model you created. For example, suppose you’re using
Ridge Regression and manipulating the value of λ. In that case, your table should
contain the training and validation accuracy for every lambda value you used. You
should provide the precision and recall
5. Why: Your write-up should analytically discuss your experimental findings; and
what conclusions you can draw from your work. You should appeal to the concepts
discussed in class: overfitting, underfitting, variance, bias, etc.

---
You and your partner will give a six-minute presentation to the class. The final project
presentations will be held during the last 1 or 2 class periods and during the final exam
period for this class. You will be assigned a day for your presentation. If we run out of
time the day you are to present your project, you will present the next day reserved for
presentations.
You are required to watch the other students’ presentations in class. A large part of
your project grade will be based on your attendance for everyone else’s presentation.
If you have a project idea that doesn’t satisfy all the requirements mentioned above,
please inform me, and we can discuss its viability as your final project.
1
If you wish to use a model not discussed in class, you must discuss it with me first, or you will not
receive any points for that model.
2Even if you get a very high accuracy, perform these transformations to see what happens.

If you use techniques not covered in class, you must demonstrate your understanding
of these ideas.
